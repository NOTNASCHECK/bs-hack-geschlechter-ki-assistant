5. Measuring blood pressure;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended to measure BP using a validated and calibrated device, to enforce the correct measurement technique, and to apply a consistent approach to BP measurement for each patient.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
Out-of-office BP measurement is recommended for diagnostic purposes, particularly because it can detect both white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension. Where out-of-office measurements are not logistically and/or economically feasible, then it is recommended that the diagnosis be confirmed with a repeat office BP measurement using the correct standardized measurement technique.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
"Most automated oscillometric monitors have not been validated for BP measurement in AF; BP measurement should be considered using a manual auscultatory method in these circumstances, where possible.";IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
An assessment for orthostatic hypotension (≥20 systolic BP and/or ≥10 diastolic BP mmHg drop at 1 and/or 3 min after standing) should be considered at least at the initial diagnosis of elevated BP or hypertension and thereafter if suggestive symptoms arise. This should be performed after the patient is first lying or sitting for 5 min.;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
6. Definition and classification of elevated blood pressure and hypertension, and cardiovascular disease risk assessment;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended to use a risk-based approach in the treatment of elevated BP, and individuals with moderate or severe CKD, established CVD, HMOD, diabetes mellitus, or familial hypercholesterolaemia are considered at increased risk for CVD events.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended that, irrespective of age, individuals with elevated BP and a SCORE2 or SCORE2-OP CVD risk of ≥10% be considered at increased risk for CVD for the purposes of risk-based management of their elevated BP.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
SCORE2-Diabetes should be considered to estimate CVD risk among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with elevated BP, particularly if they are <60 years of age.;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
History of pregnancy complications (gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, pre-term delivery, pre-eclampsia, one or more stillbirths, and recurrent miscarriage) are sex-specific risk modifiers that should be considered to up-classify individuals with elevated BP and borderline increased 10-year CVD risk (5% to <10% risk).;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
High-risk ethnicity (e.g. South Asian), family history of premature onset atherosclerotic CVD, socio-economic deprivation, auto-immune inflammatory disorders, HIV, and severe mental illness are risk modifiers shared by both sexes that should be considered to up-classify individuals with elevated BP and borderline increased 10-year CVD risk (5% to <10% risk).;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
After assessing 10-year predicted CVD risk and non-traditional CVD risk modifiers, if a risk-based BP-lowering treatment decision remains uncertain for individuals with elevated BP, measuring CAC score, carotid or femoral plaque using ultrasound, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin or B-type natriuretic peptide biomarkers, or arterial stiffness using pulse wave velocity, may be considered to improve risk stratification among patients with borderline increased 10-year CVD risk (5% to <10% risk) after shared decision-making and considering costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;
7. Diagnosing hypertension and investigating underlying causes;;;;;;;;;;;;
Opportunistic screening for elevated BP and hypertension should be considered: ;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
At least every 3 years for adults aged <40 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;
At least annually for adults aged ≥40 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;
In individuals with elevated BP who do not currently meet risk thresholds for BP-lowering treatment, a repeat BP measurement and risk assessment within 1 year should be considered.;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
Other forms of screening for hypertension (i.e. systematic screening, self-screening, and non-physician screening) may be considered, depending on their feasibility in different countries and healthcare systems.;IIb;B;;;;;;;;;;
In individuals with increased CVD risk where their screening office BP is 120–139/70–89 mmHg, it is recommended to measure BP out of office, using ABPM and/or HBPM or, if not logistically feasible, make repeated office BP measurements on more than one visit.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
Objective evaluation of adherence (either directly observed treatment or detecting prescribed drugs in blood or urine samples) should be considered in the clinical work-up of patients with apparent resistant hypertension, if resources allow.;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
If moderate-to-severe CKD is diagnosed, it is recommended to repeat measurements of serum creatinine, eGFR, and urine ACR at least annually.;I;C;;;;;;;;;;
Coronary artery calcium scoring may be considered in patients with elevated BP or hypertension when it is likely to change patient management.;IIb;B;;;;;;;;;;
Patients with resistant hypertension should be considered for referral to clinical centres with expertise in hypertension management for further testing.;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended that patients with hypertension presenting with suggestive signs, symptoms, or medical history of secondary hypertension are appropriately screened for secondary hypertension.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
Screening for primary aldosteronism by renin and aldosterone measurements should be considered in all adults with confirmed hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg).;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
8. Preventing and treating elevated blood pressure;;;;;;;;;;;;
Opportunistic screening with office BP measurements to monitor development of BP during late childhood and adolescence, especially if one or both parents have hypertension, should be considered to better predict development of adult hypertension and associated CVD risk.;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended to restrict free sugar consumption, in particular sugar-sweetened beverages, to a maximum of 10% of energy intake. It is also recommended to discourage consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, starting at young age.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
In patients with hypertension without moderate-to-advanced CKD and with high daily sodium intake, an increase of potassium intake by 0.5–1.0 g/day—for example through sodium substitution with potassium-enriched salt (comprising 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride) or through diets rich in fruits and vegetables—should be considered.;IIa;A;;;;;;;;;;
In patients with CKD or taking potassium-sparing medication, such as some diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or spironolactone, monitoring serum levels of potassium should be considered if dietary potassium is being increased.;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended to take medications at the most convenient time of day for the patient, to establish a habitual pattern of medication taking to improve adherence.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
In adults with elevated BP and low/medium CVD risk (<10% over 10 years), BP lowering with lifestyle measures is recommended and can reduce the risk of CVD.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
In adults with elevated BP and sufficiently high CVD risk, after 3 months of lifestyle intervention, BP lowering with pharmacological treatment is recommended for those with confirmed BP ≥130/80 mmHg to reduce CVD risk.;I;A;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended that in hypertensive patients with confirmed BP ≥140/90 mmHg, irrespective of CVD risk, lifestyle measures and pharmacological BP-lowering treatment is initiated promptly to reduce CVD risk.;I;A;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended to maintain BP-lowering drug treatment lifelong, even beyond the age of 85 years, if well tolerated.;I;A;;;;;;;;;;
Because the benefit in reducing CVD outcomes is uncertain in these settings, and noting that close monitoring of treatment tolerance is advised, BP-lowering treatment should only be considered from ≥140/90 mmHg (office) among persons meeting the following criteria: ;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
"pre-treatment symptomatic orthostatic hypotension;";;;;;;;;;;;;
"age ≥85 years;";;;;;;;;;;;;
"clinically significant moderate-to-severe frailty;";;;;;;;;;;;;
and/or limited predicted lifespan (<3 years).;;;;;;;;;;;;
In cases where BP-lowering treatment is poorly tolerated and achieving a target systolic of 120–129 mmHg is not possible, it is recommended to target a systolic BP level that is ‘as low as reasonably achievable’ (ALARA principle).;I;A;;;;;;;;;;
Once BP is controlled and stable under BP-lowering therapy, at least a yearly follow-up for BP and other CVD risk factors should be considered.;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
Continued ;;;;;;;;;;;;
9. Managing specific patient groups or circumstances;;;;;;;;;;;;
Young adults;;;;;;;;;;;;
Comprehensive screening for the main causes of secondary hypertension is recommended in adults diagnosed with hypertension before the age of 40 years, except for obese young adults where it is recommended to start with an obstructive sleep apnoea evaluation.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
Since SCORE2 has not been validated for individuals <40 years, screening for HMOD may be considered in such young individuals with elevated BP without other increased CVD risk conditions to identify additional individuals for possible medical treatment.;IIb;B;;;;;;;;;;
Hypertension in pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;;;
In consultation with an obstetrician, low- to moderate-intensity exercise is recommended in all pregnant women without contraindications to reduce the risk of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
HBPM and ABPM should be considered to exclude white-coat and masked hypertension, which are more common in pregnancy.;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
Older and frail patients;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended that treatment of elevated BP and hypertension among older patients aged <85 years who are not moderately to severely frail follows the same guidelines as for younger people, provided BP-lowering treatment is well tolerated.;I;A;;;;;;;;;;
When initiating BP-lowering treatment for patients aged ≥85 years, and/or with moderate-to-severe frailty (at any age), long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or RAS inhibitors should be considered, followed, if necessary, by a low-dose diuretic if tolerated, but preferably not a beta-blocker (unless compelling indications exist) or an alpha-blocker.;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
"As the safety and efficacy of BP treatment is less certain in individuals with moderate or severe frailty, clinicians should consider screening older adults for frailty using validated clinical tests; frail patients’ health priorities and a shared-decision approach should be considered when deciding on BP treatments and targets.";IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
If BP drops with progressing frailty, deprescription of BP-lowering medications (and other drugs that can reduce BP, such as sedatives and prostate-specific alpha-blockers) may be considered.;IIb;C;;;;;;;;;;
Hypertension and orthostatic hypotension;;;;;;;;;;;;
Before starting or intensifying BP-lowering medication, it is recommended to test for orthostatic hypotension, by first having the patient sit or lie for 5 min and then measuring BP 1 and/or 3 min after standing.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended to pursue non-pharmacological approaches as the first-line treatment of orthostatic hypotension among persons with supine hypertension. For such patients, it is also recommended to switch BP-lowering medications that worsen orthostatic hypotension to an alternative BP-lowering therapy and not to simply de-intensify therapy.;I;A;;;;;;;;;;
Chronic kidney disease;;;;;;;;;;;;
In hypertensive patients with CKD and eGFR >20 mL/min/1.73 m2, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended to improve outcomes in the context of their modest BP-lowering properties.;I;A;;;;;;;;;;
Other conditions;;;;;;;;;;;;
BP-lowering drug treatment is recommended for people with pre-diabetes or obesity when confirmed office BP is ≥140/90 mmHg or when office BP is 130–139/80–89 mmHg and the patient is at predicted 10-year risk of CVD ≥10% or with high-risk conditions, despite a maximum of 3 months of lifestyle therapy.;I;A;;;;;;;;;;
In patients with a history of aortic valve stenosis and/or regurgitation who require BP-lowering treatment, RAS blockers should be considered as part of that treatment.;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
In patients with a history of moderate-to-severe mitral valve regurgitation who require BP-lowering treatment, RAS blockers should be considered as part of that treatment.;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
Renovascular hypertension;;;;;;;;;;;;
Renal artery angioplasty without stenting should be considered for patients with hypertension and haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia.;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
Renal artery angioplasty and stenting may be considered in patients with haemodynamically significant, atherosclerotic, renal artery stenosis (stenosis of 70%–99%, or 50%–69% with post-stenotic dilatation and/or significant trans-stenotic pressure gradient) with: ;IIb;C;;;;;;;;;;
"Recurrent heart failure, unstable angina, or sudden-onset flash pulmonary oedema despite maximally tolerated medical therapy;";;;;;;;;;;;;
"Resistant hypertension;";;;;;;;;;;;;
"Hypertension with unexplained unilaterally small kidney or CKD;";;;;;;;;;;;;
Bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary viable kidney.;;;;;;;;;;;;
Renal artery angioplasty is not recommended in patients without confirmed haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.;III;A;;;;;;;;;;
10. Acute and short-term lowering of blood pressure;;;;;;;;;;;;
In patients with intracerebral haemorrhage presenting with systolic BP ≥220 mmHg, acute reduction in systolic BP >70 mmHg from initial levels within 1 h of commencing treatment is not recommended.;III;B;;;;;;;;;;
Continued ;;;;;;;;;;;;
11. Patient-centred care in hypertension;;;;;;;;;;;;
An informed discussion about CVD risk and treatment benefits tailored to the needs of a patient is recommended as part of hypertension management.;I;C;;;;;;;;;;
Motivational interviewing should be considered for patients with hypertension at hospitals and community health centres to assist patients in controlling their BP and to enhance treatment adherence.;IIa;B;;;;;;;;;;
Physician–patient web communications are an effective tool that should be considered in primary care, including reporting on home BP readings.;IIa;C;;;;;;;;;;
Home BP measurement for managing hypertension by using self-monitored BP is recommended to achieve better BP control.;I;B;;;;;;;;;;
Self-measurement, when properly performed, is recommended due to positive effects on the acceptance of a diagnosis of hypertension, patient empowerment, and adherence to treatment.;I;C;;;;;;;;;;
Enhanced self-monitoring of BP using a device paired with a connected smartphone application may be considered, though evidence to date suggests that this may be no more effective than standard self-monitoring.;IIb;B;;;;;;;;;;
Multidisciplinary approaches in the management of patients with elevated BP and hypertension, including appropriate and safe task-shifting away from physicians are recommended to improve BP control.;I;A ;;;;;;;;;;
 Recommendations in 2024 version; Classa; Levelb;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 It is recommended that BP be categorized as non-elevated BP, elevated BP, and hypertension to aid treatment decisions.; I; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 SCORE2 is recommended for assessing 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD among individuals aged 40–69 years with elevated BP who are not already considered at increased risk due to moderate or severe CKD, established CVD, HMOD, diabetes mellitus, or familial hypercholesterolaemia.; I; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 SCORE2-OP is recommended for assessing the 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD among individuals aged ≥70 years with elevated BP who are not already considered at increased risk due to moderate or severe CKD, established CVD, HMOD, diabetes mellitus, or familial hypercholesterolaemia.; I; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Where screening office BP is 140–159/90–99 mmHg, it is recommended that the diagnosis of hypertension should be based on out-of-office BP measurement with ABPM and/or HBPM. If these measurements are not logistically or economically feasible, then diagnosis can be made on repeated office BP measurements on more than one visit.; I; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Where screening office BP is ≥160/100 mmHg: ; I; C;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended that BP 160–179/100–109 mmHg be confirmed as soon as possible (e.g. within 1 month) preferably by either home or ambulatory BP measurements.;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended when BP ≥180/110 mmHg that hypertensive emergency be excluded.;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Echocardiography is recommended in patients with hypertension and ECG abnormalities, or signs or symptoms of cardiac disease.; I; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Echocardiography may be considered in patients with elevated BP, particularly when it is likely to change patient management.; IIb; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Ultrasound examination of the carotid or femoral arteries for detecting plaque may be considered in patients with elevated BP or hypertension when it is likely to change patient management.; IIb; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Measurement of PWV may be considered in patients with elevated BP or hypertension when it is likely to change patient management.; IIb; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Moderate intensity aerobic exercise of ≥150 min/week (≥30 min, 5–7 days/week) or alternatively 75 min of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise per week over 3 days are recommended and should be complemented with low- or moderate-intensity dynamic or isometric resistance training (2–3 times/week) to reduce BP and CVD risk.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 It is recommended to aim for a stable and healthy BMI (20–25 kg/m2) and waist circumference values (<94 cm in men and <80 cm in women) to reduce BP and CVD risk.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Adopting a healthy and balanced diet, such as the Mediterranean or DASH diets, is recommended to help reduce BP and CVD risk.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Men and women are recommended to drink less alcohol than the upper limit, which is about 100 g/week of pure alcohol. How this translates into number of drinks depends on portion size (the standards of which differ per country), but most drinks contain 8–14 g of alcohol per drink. Preferably, it is recommended to avoid alcohol to achieve the best health outcomes.; I; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Among all BP-lowering drugs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, dihydropyridine CCBs, and diuretics (thiazides and thiazide-like drugs such as chlorthalidone and indapamide) have demonstrated the most effective reduction of BP and CVD events, and are therefore recommended as first-line treatments to lower BP.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 If BP is not controlled with a three-drug combination and in whom spironolactone is not effective or tolerated, treatment with eplerenone instead of spironolactone, or the addition of a beta-blocker if not already indicated and, next, a centrally acting BP-lowering medication, an alpha-blocker, hydralazine, or a potassium-sparing diuretic should be considered.; IIa; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 To reduce CVD risk, it is recommended that treated systolic BP values in most adults be targeted to 120– 129 mmHg, provided the treatment is well tolerated.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In cases where on-treatment systolic BP is at or below target (120–129 mmHg) but diastolic BP is not at target (≥80 mmHg), intensifying BP-lowering treatment to achieve an on-treatment diastolic BP of 70–79 mmHg may be considered to reduce CVD risk.; IIb; C;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Because the CVD benefit of an on-treatment systolic BP target of 120–129 mmHg may not generalize to the following specific settings, personalized and more lenient systolic BP targets (e.g. <140 mmHg): should be considered among patients meeting the following criteria: ; IIa; C;;;;;;;;;;
"pre-treatment, symptomatic, orthostatic hypotension;";;;;;;;;;;;;
and/or age ≥85 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Because the CVD benefit of an on-treatment systolic BP target of 120–129 mmHg may not generalize to the following specific settings, personalized and more lenient BP targets (e.g. <140/90 mmHg) may be considered among patients meeting the following criteria: ; IIb; C;;;;;;;;;;
"clinically significant, moderate to severe frailty at any age;";;;;;;;;;;;;
and/or limited predicted lifespan (<3 years).;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 To reduce BP, and if performed at a medium-to-high volume centre, catheter-based renal denervation may be considered for resistant hypertension patients who have BP that is uncontrolled despite a three BP-lowering drug combination (including a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic), and who express a preference to undergo renal denervation after a shared risk-benefit discussion and multidisciplinary assessment.; IIb; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 To reduce BP, and if performed at a medium-to-high volume centre, catheter-based renal denervation may be considered for patients with both increased CVD risk and uncontrolled hypertension on fewer than three drugs, if they express a preference to undergo renal denervation after a shared risk-benefit discussion and multidisciplinary assessment.; IIb; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Due to a lack of adequately powered outcomes trials demonstrating its safety and CVD benefits, renal denervation is not recommended as a first-line BP-lowering intervention for hypertension.; III; C;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Renal denervation is not recommended for treating hypertension in patients with moderately to severely impaired renal function (eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2) or secondary causes of hypertension, until further evidence becomes available.; III; C;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;

 In women with gestational hypertension, starting drug treatment is recommended for those with confirmed systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg.; I; B;;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In pregnant women with chronic hypertension, starting drug treatment is recommended for those with confirmed office systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg.; I; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In women with chronic and gestational hypertension, it is recommended to lower BP below 140/90 mmHg but not below 80 mmHg for diastolic BP.; I; C;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 Systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg in pregnancy can indicate an emergency, and immediate hospitalization should be considered.; IIa; C;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In most adults with elevated BP and diabetes, after a maximum of 3 months of lifestyle intervention, BP lowering with pharmacological treatment is recommended for those with confirmed office BP ≥130/80 mmHg to reduce CVD risk.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In persons with diabetes who are receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended to target systolic BP to 120– 129 mmHg, if tolerated.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic moderate-to-severe CKD and confirmed BP ≥130/80 mmHg, lifestyle optimization and BP-lowering medication are recommended to reduce CVD risk, provided such treatment is well tolerated.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;

 ACE inhibitors or ARBs are more effective at reducing albuminuria than other BP-lowering agents and should be considered as part of the treatment strategy for patients with hypertension and microalbuminuria or proteinuria.; IIa; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In patients with symptomatic HFrEF/HFmrEF, the following treatments with BP-lowering effects are recommended to improve outcomes: ACE inhibitors (or ARBs if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated) or ARNi, beta-blocker, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitors.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In hypertensive patients with symptomatic HFpEF, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended to improve outcomes in the context of their modest BP-lowering properties.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In patients with symptomatic HFpEF who have BP above target, ARBs and/or MRAs may be considered to reduce heart failure hospitalizations and reduce BP.; IIb; B;;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;;;;
Stroke;;;;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In patients with confirmed BP ≥130/80 mmHg with a history of TIA or stroke a systolic BP target of 120–129 mmHg is recommended to reduce CVD outcomes, provided treatment is tolerated.; I; A;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In black patients from Sub-Saharan Africa who require BP-lowering treatment, combination therapy including a CCB combined with either a thiazide diuretic or a RAS blocker should be considered.; IIa; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In patients with resistant hypertension and uncontrolled BP despite use of first-line BP-lowering therapies, the addition of spironolactone to existing treatment should be considered.; IIa; B;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;
 In patients with resistant hypertension in whom spironolactone is not effective or tolerated, treatment with eplerenone instead of spironolactone, or the addition of a beta-blocker if not already indicated, and, next, a centrally acting BP-lowering medication, an alpha-blocker, or hydralazine, or a potassium-sparing diuretic should be considered.; IIa; B;;;;;;;;;;
