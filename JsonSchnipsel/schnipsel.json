For instance, in human teenage twin pairs, opposite-sex twins had more dissimilar gut microbiota compositions compared to same-sex twins during puberty, indicating a hormone-driven effect. Animal studies reinforce this: female mice show significant changes in microbiome diversity after puberty compared to males, and castrated male mice no longer exhibit the usual sex-specific microbiome differences (highlighting testosterone's role). Conversely, giving testosterone to gonadectomized male mice prevents those microbial changes. Similarly, removing ovarian hormones in female mice (ovariectomy) alters the microbiota (e.g., reducing Proteobacteria, increasing Akkermansia), underscoring that both male and female sex hormones shape the gut ecosystem at puberty.",

The greatest microbiome differences were observed when comparing pre-menopausal women to post-menopausal women, and pre-menopausal women to men, suggesting that the drop in estrogen with menopause contributes to microbiota shifts.

In other words, even if women's cardiorespiratory fitness gains are modest, their protection against heart disease and related mortality with regular exercise is higher. Furthermore, female athletes have a lower risk of exercise-related cardiac complications (like coronary calcification, left ventricular fibrosis, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death) compared to male athletes given similar training exposure.",

As women age and particularly after menopause, their risk of CVD accelerates, narrowing the gap with men. Notably, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women across all ages, and in recent years hospitalizations and mortality due to CVD have been rising among younger and middle-aged women as well, despite the traditional view of estrogen being cardioprotective.",

Clinicians should monitor changes in hormone levels in both men and women as part of cardiovascular risk assessment in older patients.

For instance, symptoms of heart attack in women are often labeled \"atypical\" because they differ from male norms, leading some providers to misdiagnose or downplay women's cardiac symptoms. Younger women with chest pain may face skepticism (the erroneous assumption that \"a woman cannot be having a heart attack\"). As a result, women experience longer delays in emergency departments, are more likely to be misdiagnosed or have their symptoms dismissed, and are less often prescribed appropriate medications or referred to cardiac rehabilitation after events. These disparities in care contribute to women having higher complication rates and worse recovery after myocardial infarction compared to men.",
